# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project is a simple web-based digit recognition system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits (0–9) in a browser, and the model will predict the digit using a Flask backend and TensorFlow model.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow
* Flask
* HTML/CSS/JS

## 🚀 Features

🎨 Draw digits (0–9) directly in the browser.

🔍 Predict handwritten digits using a trained CNN.

📦 Uses TensorFlow, Flask, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 Simple, clean UI with real-time predictions.
